** Code Review
- Discussion over a piece of code. Typically between the author and a
  reviewer who provides feedback on code quality and/or functionality.
- Code review is fairly common in the software industry and open
  source communities.
- Code review is beneficial at different levels:
  + Increased code quality (.e.g readability)
  + Knowledge transfer and mentoring
  + Team awareness and group ownership of the project.
  + Reduction of bus factor
  Overall code review benefits both individuals and a team's
  productivity and wellbeing.
- Code review can take different forms,
  - Synchronous (live) discussion.
  - Asynchronous discussion (email or development platforms like
    GitHub).
  - One to one (1 author and 1 reviewer)
  - Many to one
  - Many to many
  - ...
- Code reviews are performed throughout a project, on small changes,
  as opposed to larger end-of-work reviews.
- The concept of code review is vague but all in all is about spending
  some time studying and reviewing somebody else's code and discussing
  your code with someone else.
** Returns on investement
- Improved code quality.
  + Readability is difficult to self-assess. How can you tell if your
    code is readable?
  + Feedback on design decisions. Particularly important if you are
    writing a library.
  + Catch sight of gotchas: performance, language idioms, design
    flaws, corner cases. "Second pair of eyes effect".
  Code reviews are excellent at assessing readability. Few researchers
  submit a paper or grant proposal without several rounds of feedback
  by colleagues. Should code be different? If you think that no one will
  read your code or reuse it, think again.
- Learning and knowledge transfer.
  + Mentoring and disseminiation of best practices from more
    experienced to less experienced.
  + Even two researchers with similar programming experience can learn
    a lot from comparing their different approaches.
  + Less experienced researchers are valuable reviewers. They are an
    excellent benchmark of readability and are rewarded with mentored
    exposure to more advanced practices.
  Regular code reviews within a resaerch group can quickly level the
  group up and raise less experienced member's condifence.
- Collaboration
  + Regular code reviews means regular interactions and discussions
    between members of a research team or community. This reinforce
    group awareness, trust and cohesion. Beyond productivity as a
    group, it makes work nicer.
  + Opportunities to "talk code", instead of focusing on the
    science. Experimentalists discuss their tools all the time,
    research software developers can talk about theirs too. This in
    turn impacts the science.
  + Improved software sustainability. Typical timescale of research
    software is 3 years (or duration of a PhD/post-doc contract). Code
    reviews help spreading ownership of the code and transfer it to
    new arrivals.
** Good practices
- Small code reviews, often.
  + reviewing code demands strong focus.
  + if your code is reviewed regularly, you /have/ to keep it in a
    tidy state. I.e. you have to keep readers in mind.
  + Large, end-of-work reviews are daunting. Procrastination.
  + Resonance analogy. If single, strong push can only get a swing
    high. Smaller, regular pushes can get it higher.
  + Short reviews are less interupting and fit more easily in a diary.
- Acknowledge the code author's responsability.
  + Submit small and coherent set of changes.
  + Ensure good layout of the code.
  + Self-review, write tests.
  + Provide context to the reviewer.
- Start with a discussion.
  - Levels of experience should be acknowledged and expectations set
    before the review starts. A reviewer will look at the code
    differently whether they look for bugs or performance issues.
    + Example situation 1: Author is a begineer programmer and reviewer is
      experienced. Author thinks that code is slow but both agree that
      review should focus on readability.
    + Example situation 2: Author and reviewers are colleagues with
      similar level of programming experience. Author's code is
      performing surprinsigly badly. Both afree that they should have
      a look at performance and refrain from spending too much time on
      discussing language idioms and functionalities.
  - Be sure you understand the other person's context and mindset
    before reviewing code or engaging with feedback.
- What to look for depends on code review focus.
  + By default, focus on readability, then maintainability.
  + Debugging and performance optimization are much easier with
    readable code, but can cause more problems otherwise.
  + Variable and function names, complicated lines, duplicated
    code... examples are coming in the hands-on session.
- Don't be shy on positive dfeedback.
  + Don't force it, but remember that positive feedback is also
    valuable. If you learn something from the code you are reviewing,
    say it.
- Take difference of perspectives into account, at all times.
  + A "reasearcher who codes" will have a different perspective than a
    Research Software Engineer.
  + Adapting your feedback or explanations to the other's perspective
    is key to a succesful code review. Experienced programmers must
    force themselves to "state the obvious". Less experienced
    programmers must accept that some comments may seem pointless at
    first sight.
- The code is under review, not its author.
  - As a reviewer, acknowledge that author put himself in a vulnerable
    position by openning their work for feedback.
  - "You should rename this function" vs "This function could
    (should?) be renamed" vs "This function's name didn't help me
    understand what it does". A reviewer is better off raising
    questions for the author to reach their own conlusions, rather
    than expressing a judgement.
  - Authors must accept negative criticism of their code, or
    suggestion of alternatives.
  - If reviewer's feedback is deemed unfair or aggressive by the
    author, it is their prerogative to disengage from the review
    process.
** Getting started with code review
- Find reviewers
  + In your research group
  + In your lab
  + In your institution (code review club or network)
  + Ask your PI!
- Choose a code to review
  - Lower your expectations
  - Aim for 45 minutes max for a reviewer, rule of thumb 200 LOC.
  - Likely the whole codebase won't be reviewed. Pick a part that you
    are not confident about (or very confident if you wish to
    challenge your assumptions). Pick a part that is representative of
    your programming practices.
  - The reviewer can help choosing the code to review.
- Start with a conversation
  + If needed, introduce yourself, your background and relevant experience.
  + State any expectations for the review process.
  + As the author, provide reviewer with scientific and academic
    context. Example: this is a heavily numerical module that fits
    within a larger ecosystem. I have been working on this for the
    past couple of days. Example: This is a script that simplifies my
    own persnal experimental setup, I wrote it 2 years ago from
    another student's script.
  + Come up with a benefit or goal for the review. 
- Decide on the form and agree to a plan
  + prefer live discussion if possible. It makes it easier to identify
    the other person's mindset and build trust.
  + Give the reviewer some time to make their own independent
    ideas. For instance they receive the code in advance.
  + Small code reviews, often. If agreement to review a large
    codebase, agree on a series of meetings.
- Engage in code reviews on a weekly basis. Make it part of your and
  your group's routine.

** Why aren't you doing code review already?
- You don't about it (enough)
- You don't have time
- You don't know who to do it with
- You don't care about your code
- You wouldn't know what to look for as a reviewer
- You tried it once but it didn't feel very productive.
** Small but frequent code reviews
- reviewing demands strong focus
- Big code reviews are daunting.
- Short meetings fit better in a busy schedule
** Make sure beginners also review
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (none roll-in roll-in) :frag_idx (- 1 2)
- If a beginner Python programmer understands my code, it is readable.
- "Naive" point of views are valuable (expert blindspot).
- Beginners won't stay beginners for long.

** Prefer live discussion

** Set the review up for success
Authors can make the review much easier by:
- Identifying a small, coherent chunk of code (< 200 lines)
- Providing context
- Making sure the code is tidy ([[https://github.com/psf/black#readme][Black]], [[https://github.com/r-lib/styler#readme][styler]])
- Providing unit tests

  it'd make this part of the code much clearer".

1. Find reviewers
2. Choose a chunk of code to review
3. Start with a conversation
